SIFT_features.m:
Script to extract SIFT features from images (which must all be in
the same folder). This script relies on the vlfeat library, available on 
http://www.vlfeat.org/install-matlab.html.

SIFT_features.py:
Code that extracts the SIFT figures from a set of images. These images must all be in the same folder.
This code necessitates the use of an older version of the contrib version of the openCV package (because SIFT is a patented algorithm...).
